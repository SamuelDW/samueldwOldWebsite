<p>This project was started in September of 2019, for the Honours Stage project for the University of Hull. Tasked was the building of a site to host and manage quiz games, of which was chosen a web based route.
Developed using the idea of a host and participant model seen in pubs and quizzes, it aimed to combine a variety of features seen in other sites and apps to bring about a new, or different experience than what was
already available to people.</p>
